Maru only supports integers. Because who needs floats? They only create problems...

## MARU Playground
You can try MARU in your browser! For this head to the [Maru Playground](http://35.246.8.185:5000/).

The code for the playground is available in the [maru-playground repo](https://github.com/Maximophone/maru-playground.git).

**Note**: The server is a f1-micro machine hosted in GCP so don't expect stellar performance.

## Examples
Head to the [examples](./examples) folder for demos of Maru programs.

## Known issues:
 - Not really an issue but initialising a class element with an array means that the instances will share the same array
